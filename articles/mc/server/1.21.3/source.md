# 1.21.3 Server Update

**After much work and frustration the server is finally up again, phew! ðŸ’©**


## Hosting

Given my previous hosting provider caused a lot of reoccuring dataloss and had generally slow support times, I have finally switched hosting provider.
The server is now generously hosted by @PigiBlossom!

**Because of this the ip and port numbers have changed, please refer to the discord for the new adress!**


## ServerSide
- **Version Change**
<br>
    I haven't had time to update my clients for 1.21.3, until then you may use any other 1.21.3 client or add [ViaFabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabric) or [ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus) to your modpacks.

- **Mod Changes**
<br>
    - Replaced `AntiEntityGrief` with `MobExplosionGriefingGamerule`.
    - Skipped `DisconnectPacketFix` since it is not updated.
    - Skipped `Horsebuff` since it is not updated.
    - Skipped `LeashMod` since it is not updated.
    - Also skipped some other maintenance mods for the same reason.
    - Replaced `Fsit` with `!Sit` mod, since it was broken, this sadly means no sitting on players for now :(
    - Replaced `SnowballKB` with my mod `KBSnowballs`.
    - Added `BsBluemap` mod by me.

- **Datapack / Resourcepack Changes**
<br>
    - Forked MoreArmorTrims to work with 1.21.3, sadly no emmissives for now...


## What next?
- Fixing any missing features.
- Making 1.21.3 clients.
- 1.21.4 Will change how items work in resourcepacks so I am planning on re-making the server resourcepack from the ground up.
- Also some more stability testing and work!
