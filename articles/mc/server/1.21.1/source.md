## ServerSide

    yada yada


## Server Resource Pack
* Updated alot of non-player-accessible items to use vanillas `CustomModelData` instead of CIT.
* Forked MoreArmorTrims to include materials for the ´bolt´ and ´flow´ armor trims.

## What next?
Due to the mentioned server-hosting issues I will be looking into alternative hosting providers in the next comming days.
